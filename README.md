# GeneticAlgorithm

Is based on the idea of natural selection and genetics. Is an intelligent exploration of random search provided with historical data.

Commonly used to generate high-quality solution for optimization


###  Fundamentals of the Algorithm

- Individuals compete for resources and reproduce

- The fittest individuals will survive and reproduce

- Genes from the fittest individuals will propagate throughout the generation

- Each generation is better than the previous


### Fitness Score

An individual has a fitness score that shows its ability to compete.

### Process of evolution

- Selection Process - Gives the prefence to the individuals with good fitness scores and allow them to reproduce

- Crossover Process - A point on both parent's chromosomes are picked randomly and a crossover point. Bits to the right of that point are swapped between the two parent chromosomes. Resulting to an individual carrying some genetic infomation from their parent

- Mutation Process - low probability of changing the structure of gene, resulting in a variant from that may be transmitted to subsequent generations.
